### Branches

Whenever working on a new feature from the base game, create a new branch and then request to merge it when done so that
it doesn't override or break some other part of the game.

### Commiting
Whenever you need to commit a change to the project, save the PyBlocks project to [game.json](src/game.json). This will
ensure that the project is saved in the correct format so it can be opened in PyBlocks.

### Editing

```shell
python -m netsblox
```

Whenever you edit the game, make sure to open and save the PyBlocks project to [game.json](src/game.json).
