# plane-game

### About

This project contains the code for a Pyblocks plane game. Try to get the highest score while bouncing amongst the clouds!

### Instructions

To play, download and open the JSON file in PyBlocks. Then, after running the game, click and pull the plane back to launch. Try to rack up the highest score! Click R or click the plane in order to reset.

### Branches

Whenever working on a new feature from the base game, create a new branch and then request to merge it when done so that
it doesn't override or break some other part of the game.

### Commiting
Whenever you need to commit a change to the project, save the PyBlocks project to [game.json](src/game.json). This will
ensure that the project is saved in the correct format so it can be opened in PyBlocks.

### Editing

```shell
python -m netsblox
```

Whenever you edit the game, make sure to open and save the PyBlocks project to [game.json](src/game.json).
